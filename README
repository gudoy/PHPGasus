WHAT IS PHPGasus
PHPGasus is another PHP Framework which aims to allow quick and smart web developements being the more easy to learn & use than possible. 
It's based on well known principles

PRINCIPLES
- REST
- MVC 
- ROA
- Model Driven Development
- DRY
- KISS
- Conventions over configuration
- less is more (“Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to remove.” (Antoine de Saint-Exupéry))
- the content is the interface


REQUIREMENTS
- PHP 5 (best 5.3, or recommanded >5.2.6)
- Apache 2 (with mod_rewrite)


TOP FEATURES
- EASY SETUP (just upload files and launch setup page)
- AUTOMATIC DATABASE SCHEMA retrieval
- ORM via admin interface (or by smart & simple php files for code purists)
- DBAL with support for mysql, postgresql, sqlite & mongoDB
- ADMIN generator (scaffholding)
- API generator (scaffholding)
- PERFs optimized (includes preconfigured vhost and/or .htaccess)
- EASY to learn (no 500 pages book or 200 pages website documentation)
- HTML5 based
- OS/DEVICE & BROWSER sniffing 
- CSS/JS minification
- TEMPLATES engines included (smarty 3, Twig & Haanga)
- ACL module included (users, groups & permissions)
- PRECONFIGURED ENVIRONMENTS (local, dev, preprod, prod)
- DEFAULT OUTPUT FORMATS included for all views/pages (html, xhtml, xml, json, jsonp, jsonreport, yaml, plist, csv, rss, atom)
- SEMI-AUTOMATIC UPDATES


WHY Use PHPGasus
- you love things like Ruby on Rails, Django, Python, jQuery,
- you can stand watching the code of Wordpress & likes for their uglyness
- you're fed your current framework's verbosity (things like this "use vendor\framework\FrameworkName\And\So\On\...\Path\To\My\Lib");
- you want to start coding immediately, code few, fast, clean & secure
- you love the tools that try to guess want you want and act consequently
- you love syntactic sugar
- you don't want to read a 500 pages book or ten 20 minutes videos to start doing great things
- you don't want to have to use a CLI (Command Line Interface) to create anything
- you love smart & ergonomic interfaces (with lots of magic-ness)
- even if you are a code fanatic or interfaces hater, you can do it too (and their still some magic-ness applied)
- you prefer doing $this->users->getOneBirthdateByEmail('foo@bar.com') than $this->db->query("SELECT birthdate FROM users AS u WHERE u.email = 'foo@bar.com' LIMIT 1")


Dispatcher
In PHPGasus, every URL (except for content in public folder) is redirected to the dispatcher: index.php at the root of your project.
This function tries to call the proper method of the proper controller with proper arguments, depending of your dataModel and request params.

DISPATCHER => CONTROLLER (samples):							
GET /                                       => /CHome->index()

GET /products/?distinct  					=> SELECT DISTINCT(id) FROM products LIMIT 100 [no colum passed: will use id or pk or first found column in datamodel]
GET /products/?distinct=nonexistingcol  	=> SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 100 [nonexistingcol is ignored]
GET /products/?distinct=color 				=> SELECT DISTINCT(color) FROM products LIMIT 100

CONTROLLERS
- classname = 'C' + ucfirst(controllername)
- have to extends built in Controller
- require an 'index' method

CODING PRACTICES
#http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/php/30-php-best-practices-for-beginners/
- know types handling, transtyping/casting, comparisions
- WARNING with == and ==== comparisions
- preferer ternary operator for simple if/else testing ( condition ? "condition is true" : "condition is false" )
- avoid if/for/foreach/... nesting (more than 2 levels is BAD, more than 3 levels is REALLY BAD
- use dynamic arguments (using $args = func_get_args()) or a $params as last param of your functions
